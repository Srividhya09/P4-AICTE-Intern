**Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning**  

## **1. Problem Statement**  
Human pose estimation involves detecting and tracking key body joints (e.g., shoulders, elbows, knees) in images or videos. Despite advancements in computer vision, challenges remain, such as:  
- Achieving real-time processing.  
- Handling occlusions and overlapping body parts.  
- Maintaining accuracy across diverse poses, lighting conditions, and body types.  

Traditional methods often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness in dynamic environments. Addressing these challenges is crucial, as accurate pose estimation is foundational to applications in:  
- **Healthcare**: Physical therapy and rehabilitation monitoring.  
- **Sports Analytics**: Enhancing athlete performance and preventing injuries.  
- **Surveillance**: Detecting suspicious activities in public spaces.  
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Gesture recognition for AR/VR and interactive systems.  

Solving these limitations will enable scalable, real-world solutions for motion analysis and behavioral understanding.  


## **2. Motivation**  
This project was inspired by the increasing demand for automated systems capable of interpreting human motion in real time. Key applications include:  
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient rehabilitation exercises.  
- **Fitness**: Analyzing workout forms to prevent injuries.  
- **Entertainment**: Enhancing AR/VR experiences and gesture-controlled interactions.  
- **Surveillance**: Detecting abnormal behaviors in public areas.  

The emergence of machine learning frameworks like **MediaPipe** and **OpenPose** has democratized pose estimation, making it accessible for practical deployment. The motivation behind this project is to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications by developing an efficient, user-friendly system.
